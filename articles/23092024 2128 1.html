LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 24: Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer delivers his keynote speech during the Labour Party Conference 2024 at ACC Liverpool on September 24, 2024 in Liverpool, England. This is Labour's first conference since they were returned as the governing party of The UK and Northern Ireland by voters in the July election, ending 14 years of Conservative rule. They won with a landslide majority of 172 seats, and 412 in total.</h6>

                    <p id="Article-first-letter">A</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="One">fter having won for the first time since 2005, Keir Starmer made sure to enshrine his opportunistic but realistic vision of the country during his speech as Labour struggles through the winter fuel payment and donations rows in the absence of new details of policies being announced.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Two">Starmer opened his speech by thanking everyone at the conference as he claims this is 'the biggest attendance ever in [Labour conference's] history' and celebrates the party winning the July 2024 general election. The slogan 'country first, party second' is repeated in an attempt to show to the country that Labour will govern differently compared to the previous Conservative governments.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Three">The introduction of a Hillsborough law was mentioned early on in the speech, as Starmer vowed that it will show 'how a government of service must act'. After the numerous scandals which have plagued Britain over the years, the bill is due to be introduced to the House of Commons before its next anniversary in April.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Four">This speech marks a shift in the tone conveyed by Starmer as although there are still 'tough decisions' to be made, there is a 'light at the end of this tunnel', and anger can be heard in his voice at the state the country was left in after the Conservative Party lost power two months prior and the 'violent, racist, thugs' who rioted in late July and early August. It comes after Labour has been criticised by many that they have been too pessimistic and gloomy as people remain impatient for change. Later on in the speech, Starmer provides reasoning to decisions rather than just letting people make of it what they will. When mentioning the welfare bill, the prime minister says he will 'get welfare bill down' rather than saying it will be cut, proceeding to say that there will be 'no return to Tory austerity'. Many issues are acknowledged by the Labour leader to highlight the opportunities and prosperity ahead which can be earned by working through the issues currently facing the country. The 'ageing population' is mentioned as one of the issues at a time when neither party has explicitly mentioned it.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Five">The prime minister attacked the Tories on their record in government on several failures, including the £700mn Rwanda scheme and the attempts of 'mining the pits of division' and 'fixing [the country's] attention on those issues' while ignoring the real problems facing the country.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Six">Palestine and Lebanon have made their way into the speech in order to reassure the left of the party & party members that Labour will continue to work towards 'de-escalation' in the middle east as the one-year anniversary of the October 7th event approaches. However, that didn't prevent a protestor from interrupting Rachael Reeve's speech on Monday and another during Starmer's own speech. On Monday, Angela Rayner gave a speech at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM07qT8MsXc&t=4s&pp=ygUpYW5nZWxhIHJheW5lciBsYWJvdXIgZnJpZW5kcyBvZiBwYWxlc3RpbmU%3D">Labour Friends of Palestine reception<a> at the Labour conference with a similar tone, receiving rounds of applause several times.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Seven">Following this, Starmer went on to talk about the current mood in the country and wanting to 'restore… faith in the values that have always guided this nation' and to show 'politics can be a force for good'. The prime minister attempts to reduce the low mood by stating that 'this will be tough in the short-term but in the long-term it's the right thing to' as he aims to make clear that this will not last for a long time.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Eight">The winter fuel allowance row may continue as Keir Starmer, while acknowledging some are 'concerned about' it, implies that he is unlikely to U-turn on decision to make the winter fuel allowance, saying 'if this path were popular or easy we would have walked it already' but vows 'every pensioner will be better off with Labour' as the triple lock will remain 'secured'.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Nine">Benefit fraud has been talked about increasingly as the Conservatives decided to attack PIP payments earlier this year, and Starmer states Labour will 'legislate to stop [it]' in order to maintain the welfare state. A range of other actions are mentioned after in a similar fashion, signalling that there will be things done which are not liked by those affected by them but which will need to be done in order to achieve long-term goals.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Ten">A passion can be heard in the prime minister's voice as he approaches the end of his hour-long speech. The crowd cheers and applauds as Starmer highlights the reality which can be achieved and that 'Britain belongs to you.'</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Eleven">Although the speech may be considered an improvement in some aspects compared to those in the past, it seems to have failed to garner the main attention of the media. Instead, the media continues to be fixated on donations & freebies- which are not comparable to the corruption of the Tories during their tenure in power - and the winter fuel allowance row.</p>
                    <p class="Paragraph" id="Twelve">On Wednesday 25 September, Labour members at the conference voted against the cut of the winter fuel allowance after a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/labour-conference-votes-to-reverse-cut-to-winter-fuel-allowance-in-embarrassing-blow-to-starmer-13221742">motion was tabled by the trade union Unite<a>. Although this does not force the party to change their decision, it may prove tricky to deal with after Labour have repeatedly said that they will be a 'government of service' and could become hypocritical if they firmly go against this vote.</p>
